### Production Use

The Virtual Classroom Client is a single page Javascript web application, that can be seamlessly embedded in any HTML
page and rendered in a browser.

### Versions
The most up-to-date production version of the LearnCube Virtual Classroom Client files will always be accessible at:
```html
  <!-- Virtual Classroom -->  
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://static.learncube.net/client/virtualclassroom.css">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.learncube.net/client/virtualclassroom.js"></script>
```   

From time-to-time, to ensure we always have backwards compatibility, advance testing of beta features will be made
available to users through versioned files. Eg:

```html
  <!-- Virtual Classroom With Extra Recordin Options -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://static.learncube.net/client/virtualclassroom.1.2.0css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.learncube.net/client/virtualclassroom.1.2.0js"></script>
```

Once features have passed our internal QA and testing processes, they will be merged into the main branch and released
to general audience through the non-versioned files.

***To ensure you will always have the latest classroom features in the most stable environment possible, the unversioned
files should be used in production.***

### Authentication

All API calls from the Virtual Classroom Client must be authenticated using JSON Web Tokens. For more information on
this see [Authentication](AUTH.md#authentication)

### Browser Support

The Virtual Classroom Client uses WebRTC for video and voice calls and websockets for real-time messaging. Browser
support is below.

 Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Opera | Safari | Safari iOS | Chrome Android | Firefox Android | Samsung 
------|---------|--------|-------|--------|------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| > 79 | > 64    | > 70   | > 56  | 12.1   | > 12.1     | > 70           | > 64            | > 11    | 

There have been many improvements in WebRTC support in the latest releases of all the above browsers. For the best
experience we recommend the most up-to-date version of a Chromium based browser.
<br/>
<br/>

### Routes

The Virtual Classroom uses hash routes to navigate you through the various views available. To avoid any conflicts,
please ensure that the page where the client code is embedded does not use hash routes.

The available views are:

- `#/onboarding/` - We perform basic tests and permission checks to ensure your browser is compataible and the required
  permissions have been granted
- `#/teacher/` - The main route for a teacher in a live class
- `#/teacher/ended/` - Video call and socket connections are closed and the user can submit feedback about the class
- `#/student/arrived/` - The waiting room for a student before the class starts
- `#/student/` - The main route for a student in a live class
- `#/student/ended/` - Video call and socket connections are closed and the user can submit feedback about the class
- `#/student/removed/` - Where the student arrives after being removed from the class by the teacher
- `#/review/` - A read-only version of the classroom without video where students and teachers can review the content
- `#/whiteboard/` - A whiteboard-only version of the classroom, designed for use with 3rd party video conferencing tools
- `#/whiteboard/ended/` - The end class view for a whiteboard only class

<br/>
<br/>

### Events

The Virtual Classroom Client emits [custom events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) to
notify you of user actions such as:

* A user entering or exiting a class
* A class starting or ending
* A user has attempted to enter a breakout room

You can track these events by attaching event listeners to the DOM element returned by the Virtual Classroom Client
constructor function.

Each event contains a detail object that has the timestamp of when the event occurred and additional data about the
event.

There is a full list of available events below in the [API Reference](#api-reference)

```javascript
const classroom = new VirtualClassroom(el, userConfig, classConfig)

classroom.addEventListener('enterClass', function (evt) {
    const user = evt.detail.user;
    const timestamp = evt.detail.timestamp;
    console.log('User ' + user.username + 'entered the class at ' + timestamp)
});

classroom.addEventListener('exitClass', function (evt) {
    // redirect to your own custom feedback form
    window.location.href = 'https://feedback.your-domain.com'
});

classroom.addEventListener('enterBreakoutRoom', function (evt) {
    const breakoutRoomToken = evt.detail.token;
    const breakoutRoomUser = evt.detail.userid;
    console.log('Redirect ' + user.username + 'to a new url to enter the breakout room with the token ' + breakoutRoomToken)
});

classroom.addEventListener('whiteboardAction', function (evt) {
    console.log('whiteboardAction', evt.detail)
});

classroom.addEventListener('apiConfigError', function (evt) {
    console.log('apiConfigError', evt)
})
```

### Triggers

The Virtual Classroom Client also listens to custom events that you can trigger from your own JavaScript runtime. The
events can be used to start or end a class.

```javascript
const classroom = new VirtualClassroom(el, userConfig, classConfig)
classroom.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('startClass', {'detail': {}}))
```

<br/>
<br/>

### Breakout Rooms

[Breakout Rooms](https://support.learncube.com/en/articles/4149866-using-learncube-s-breakout-rooms-feature) are
additional child rooms that can be used to split a group class into smaller separate classes.

Breakout rooms can be created through the UI in the classroom or using the REST API. <!-- [REST API](RESTAPI.md).-->
Programatically, they are identical to a standard room, just with a reference to the parent room.

To navigate between the parent room and breakout rooms, the user must first exit the current room, and then enter the
breakout room. The recommended way to allow this is to have a unique URL for each classroom.

A teacher can enter a Breakout Room by clicking a link in the UI. A student can be placed into the breakout room by the
teacher. In both of these cases the Virtual Classroom Client will emit a custom event containing the room token for the
breakout room. You must handle this event in order to exit one room and enter another.
