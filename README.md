### Quickstart Guide 

LearnCube's Virtual Classroom Client is a simple to use drop-in widget that allows you to embed a fully equipped virtual classroom in any web page or LMS.

LearnCube's Virtual Classroom is only available to LearnCube customers with API access enabled. Getting started is simple. 

- Log in to your [LearnCube Account](https://app.learncube.com/), or [Sign up here for free](https://app.learncube.com/app/create/).
- Get your public and private [API keys here](https://app.learncube.com/app/dashboard/#api) from your LearnCube API Dashboard. (Leave the account mode to testing in order to follow this example)
- Clone the quickstart app to your local machine and cd into the directory

  ```shell 
  git clone https://github.com/LearnCube/virtualclassroomclient.git
  cd virtualclassroomclient
  ```

- Create a configuration file for your application.
  
  ```shell
  cp template.env .env
  ```
  
- Replace the variables in the newly created `.env` file with real data from your LearnCube API account. 

  ```
  # Private Key
  privateKey={privatekeyfromyouraccount}

  # LearnCube user username
  username={usernamefromyouraccount}

  # LearnCube user id
  user_id={useridfromyouraccount}

  # LearnCube user email
  email={emailyouusedtosignup}
  ```
  ***Important: This must match the user data we have stored for the LearnCube account holder.***

- Replace the Classroom participant data in the `index.html` file with user data of a classroom participant. 

  ***Note: This does not have to match the user data in your `.env` file. All your classroom participants, teachers, students and admins, will access the classroom using your LearnCube account details.***

                  'validateUrl': '/get-valid-token/'
              });
      </script>
  ```

- Install dependencies and run 
  ```shell
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
